# Test Strategy & Test Plan

## Test Strategy

### Purpose

This test strategy defines the overall approach for testing the TaskBot Telegram bot application. It covers verification of:
- Individual function components and modules
- Integration between bot commands and the database
- End-to-end bot workflows and user interactions
- All features work as expected in the Telegram UI
- Database operations, AI service responses, and reminder scheduling
- Data formatting and output validation

### Scope

#### What is Tested
- **Database module (database.py)**: All CRUD operations and query functions
- **AI Service (ai_service.py)**: All 4 functions for task summarization and AI-powered features
- **Formatters (formatters.py)**: All 6 formatting functions for message output
- **Bot Handlers (handlers.py)**: All 10 bot commands
- **Reminders (reminders.py)**: Scheduler job functionality and reminder execution
- **Integration**: Bot commands working with database and external services

#### What is NOT Tested
- Telegram API internals and framework behavior
- OpenAI model accuracy and training
- Third-party library implementations
- Network infrastructure outside of the bot

### Test Levels

#### Unit Testing
- Individual functions in isolation
- Database operations (queries, inserts, updates, deletes)
- AI service response processing
- Formatter functions with various input types
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies

#### Integration Testing
- Bot commands executing with database interactions
- Command handlers connecting to AI service
- Reminder scheduler triggering database updates
- Data flow between modules
- Error propagation and recovery

#### System Testing
- Full end-to-end bot flow on deployed server
- User interactions via Telegram UI
- Real database operations
- Reminder execution in production environment
- External service interactions

#### Manual Testing
- Telegram UI interactions and user experience
- Command execution through Telegram client
- Message display and formatting verification
- Button interactions and inline keyboards
- Real-time reminder notifications
- Edge cases through manual input

### Test Approach

#### Automated Testing
- **Framework**: pytest for unit and integration tests
- **Async Support**: pytest-asyncio for async function testing
- **Database Testing**: In-memory SQLite or test database fixtures
- **Mocking**: Mock external API calls (OpenAI)
- **Coverage**: Aim for >80% code coverage on critical modules

#### Manual Testing
- **Platform**: Telegram mobile and web clients
- **Testers**: Solo developer testing all features
- **Execution**: Command execution and response verification
- **User Experience**: Validate output formatting and usability

### Test Environment

#### Local Development
- **Machine**: Development workstation (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- **Database**: SQLite test database
- **Purpose**: Unit and integration testing
- **Dependencies**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, test fixtures

#### Deployed Server
- **Infrastructure**: Production Telegram bot server
- **Database**: Production SQLite database or staging copy
- **Purpose**: System testing and end-to-end validation
- **User**: Real or test Telegram user account

### Test Data

#### Predefined Test Users
- Test user accounts with various permission levels
- Users with no tasks, few tasks, and many tasks
- Users with different task completion rates

#### Predefined Test Tasks
- Simple single-word tasks
- Long descriptive tasks
- Tasks with special characters and Unicode
- Tasks with different priority levels
- Overdue tasks and future-dated tasks

#### Edge Case Inputs
- Empty strings and whitespace-only inputs
- Very long inputs (>1000 characters)
- Special characters and emoji
- Malformed dates and invalid formats
- Boundary values (min/max task counts)
- Concurrent operations on same data

### Entry and Exit Criteria

#### Entry Criteria
- Code changes are complete and reviewed
- Code is stable and compile/syntax errors resolved
- All changes are pushed to GitHub repository
- Development environment is set up and functional
- Test environment and data are prepared

#### Exit Criteria
- All critical test cases pass (100% pass rate)
- No critical or high-severity bugs remaining
- Test coverage meets minimum threshold (>80%)
- Test report is documented and reviewed
- Performance meets acceptable baseline
- Known limitations are documented

## Test Plan

### Test Objectives

- **Verify Functionality**: Ensure all 10 bot commands work as designed
- **Verify Data Integrity**: Confirm database CRUD operations maintain data consistency
- **Verify AI Integration**: Validate AI service produces appropriate responses
- **Verify User Experience**: Ensure bot responds correctly through Telegram UI
- **Verify Reliability**: Confirm reminder scheduling and execution work reliably
- **Identify Defects**: Find and document any bugs or unexpected behavior
- **Establish Baseline**: Create reproducible test results for regression testing

### Test Scope

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Database state inconsistency during tests | Medium | High | Use database fixtures and transactions to isolate tests |
| API rate limiting during integration tests | Medium | Medium | Mock external API calls, test with limited requests |
| Async test timing issues | Medium | Medium | Use pytest-asyncio with proper fixtures and timeouts |
| Test environment divergence from production | Low | High | Keep test environment configuration synchronized with production |
| Incomplete code coverage | Medium | Medium | Generate coverage reports and add tests for uncovered branches |
| Telegram API changes | Low | High | Test against current API version, monitor for deprecations |
| Data inconsistency between databases | Low | Medium | Use schema versioning and migration testing |
| Time-dependent test failures | Medium | Medium | Mock time-dependent functions, use fixed dates in tests |
